Customer lifetime value is a total revenue a customer would make until customer or business don't exit.

However, practically, comparing the customer value is difficult as they're acquired at different time and don't have the same lifetime, and identifying lifetime of each customer will be an additional inefficent task.

To effectively compare customer value, we establish a fixed timeline, referred to as the "horizon," over which these comparisons are made. This approach allows us to standardize the evaluation of customer lifetime value (CLV) across different acquisition periods.

To determine the value within this timeline, we first calculate the actual revenue generated by each customer from the time of acquisition up to the present date. If this realized revenue falls short of the expected total for the designated horizon, we then estimate the potential revenue for the remaining period and add that to the actual revenue generated by customer. 
This helps in comparising across different aquisition period (i.e., with differen time based cohort)
This approach has 3 main benefits:
1. customer value can be compared across different cohorts
2. predicted clv converges to realized clv as time progress
3. realized clv gives less uncertainity in the estimate (clv calculation and comparision) [if you want to use the estimate to optimize the hits in paid traffic this is huge advantage]

clv helps businesses in following way:
* For ecom, optimize paid traffic or insight from transcation data.
* For subscription model, optimize CAC and retention or reducing churn
